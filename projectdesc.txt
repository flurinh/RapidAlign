# Batch-Enabled Point Cloud Alignment for Graph Neural Networks using CUDA

## 1. Overview
This project implements high-performance algorithms for batched rigid point cloud alignment on GPUs using CUDA, specifically designed for integration with Graph Neural Networks during training. The library efficiently aligns batches of point clouds with varying sizes, using both Procrustes analysis and Iterative Closest Point (ICP) methods. The primary application is computing alignment-based losses (e.g., Chamfer distance) between graph node positions in geometric/spatial graph deep learning models (such as PyTorch Geometric). By processing batches of variable-sized graphs in parallel, the implementation enables efficient training of models that require spatial alignment of graph structures.

   - Extract optimal rotation matrix using SVD or Horn's quaternion method
   - Compute translation as difference between target centroid and rotated source centroid

**Batch Processing:**
- Use batch indexing to handle varying point cloud sizes
- Allocate shared memory dynamically based on local batch item size
- Use a grid-stride loop pattern for processing arbitrarily large point clouds

### 3.2 Batched Iterative Closest Point (ICP)

2. For each batch item:
   - Find nearest neighbors using batched distance calculations
   - Apply Procrustes algorithm to corresponding pairs
   - Update transformations for each batch element
   - Iterate until convergence or max iterations

**Batch Processing:**
- Maintain separate convergence criteria for each batch item
- Use early-stopping for batch items that converge quickly
- Implement efficient nearest neighbor computation for varying point cloud sizes

### 3.3 Batched Chamfer Distance
**Purpose:** Compute Chamfer distance between pairs of point clouds in a batch.

**Method:**
1. For each point in source, find nearest point in target
2. For each point in target, find nearest point in source
3. Sum squared distances and normalize appropriately
4. Handle variable-sized point clouds using batch indexing
